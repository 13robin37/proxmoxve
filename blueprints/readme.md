# Blueprints

Here you will find some blueprints that help you to solve small integration bugs:

### When the integration does not recover after the host goes offline for an extended period of time and then comes back online:

#### Importing via My Home Assistant:
* Click this button to import:
  
  [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdougiteixeira%2Fproxmoxve%2Fnew%2Fdougiteixeira-patch-1%2Fblueprints)

#### Or do the import manually:

* Go to Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints.
* Select the blue Import Blueprint button in the bottom right.
* A new dialog will pop-up asking you for the URL.
* Enter the URL and select Preview.
* This will load the blueprint and show a preview in the import dialog.
* You can change the name and finish the import.
* The blueprint can now be used for creating automations.
